Based on the code I found, ChittyChat is "the GitHub for legal documents and evidence management". It provides GitHub-like functionality specifically designed for:

  Key GitHub-Like Features

  1. Repository Management for Legal Cases
    - Create/manage repositories for different legal cases
    - Template-based scaffolding (contracts, documentation, SDK)
    - Version control for legal documents
  2. Migration & Organization
    - Safe file migration to staging environments
    - Organization setup with teams structure
    - Automated workflows and templates
  3. Advanced Features
    - ChittyChain Integration: Mints decisions/actions to blockchain for immutable audit trail
    - Security Templates: Built-in security policies and vulnerability reporting
    - PR/Issue Templates: Structured templates for legal document reviews
    - Automated Workflows: GitHub Actions integration for legal compliance
  4. Project Management
    - Inventory tracking of all Chitty-related files
    - Migration status monitoring
    - Team permissions (core-maintainers, docs-team, security-team)

  The system essentially applies GitHub's collaborative development model to legal document management, adding cryptographic verification, chain of custody, and compliance features
  specific to legal requirements. It's not just using GitHub's native features but creating a GitHub-like experience tailored for legal professionals managing evidence and case
  documents.

⏺ How ChittyChat Hijacks Native Claude Code Functions for Project Management

  ChittyChat cleverly integrates with Claude Code's native capabilities through several mechanisms:

  1. MCP Server Integration

  ChittyChat runs as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that Claude Code can directly interact with. The .claude/settings.local.json shows it has special permissions like:
  - Bash(/Users/nb/configured/claude/mcp-servers/chittychat/bin/chittychat status:*) - Direct command execution
  - Full read access to user directories
  - Process management capabilities (pm2, launchctl, kill)

  2. Enhanced Tool Suite

  ChittyChat extends Claude Code with 20+ custom tools that appear native:
  - Blockchain tools (blockchain_add_evidence, blockchain_get_audit_trail)
  - Identity tools (identity_create, identity_sign, identity_verify)
  - Finance tools (finance_create_transaction, finance_get_balance)
  - Agent coordination (agent_submit_task, agent_get_status)

  3. Project Management Features

  - Agent Runtime: Distributed task management using Redis queues
  - ChittyChain: Immutable project history and audit trails
  - ChittyID: Cryptographic signing of all project actions
  - Service Discovery: Auto-discovers and coordinates with other ChittyOS services

  4. GitHub-Like Project Management

  The system provides GitHub-style features but for legal/business documents:
  - Repository creation with templates
  - Migration workflows with staging environments
  - Organization management with team structures
  - Automated workflows and CI/CD-like pipelines
  - Security policies and vulnerability reporting

  5. Native Integration Points

  - Direct MCP Communication: Tools appear as native Claude Code functions
  - Filesystem Permissions: Full access to read/write project files
  - Process Control: Can manage background services and daemons
  - Network Services: Runs on ports 3003, 3005, 8080 for API access

  The architecture essentially creates a parallel project management system that runs alongside Claude Code, intercepting and enhancing its capabilities with blockchain
  verification, identity management, and distributed agent coordination - all while appearing as native Claude Code functionality to the user.
